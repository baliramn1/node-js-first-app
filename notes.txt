npm install -g nodemon:
// nodemon is a package that automatically runs the program when we save it so we dont have to execute the node i.. command 
// -g means install globally not just for this project

//nodemon i (tab)
//so from now if we change the code then the result will automatically shown

import and export:
normally we import like const http = require("http")
to change this, to import like we do import in react (import http from "http")
enter type: "module" in package.json 


fs: 
with the help of fs we can write or read any file

some methods:
get: to get data
post: to create data
put: to update data
delete: to delete data  




express:
install express by "npm install express"

impor express as "express"

then goto package.json goto script array 
and add this
"scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js"
  },


so now instead of nodemon index.js 
we can execute npm run dev to run the same command

dev: is for developement that means the file should run imediately when changes are made to it.
start: is for production enviroment that means the file should execute only ones.
